Running the first paid online course for a year


## Finding a Topic To Talk About

I've been writing blog articles for over three years. There wasn't any clear direcation as I wrote about several Java Framework. 

I had no niche topic yet.

Over the years, I found my niche by blogging more and more about the same topic: testing Spring Boot applications.

## Creating The Course Content

Perfectionism will kill your progress

Get some first touchpoints with recording video and audio on YouTube.

For this course I did only record my screen and my voice. No fancy greenscreen setup. This can come.

The benefit of this approach is that you can have as a many mispellings and just have to reiterate.

For each course chapter - I'm structuring my courses like Module -> Chapter -> Lessons - I did some initial brainstorming using a Markdown file. There I pointed out what techniques and recipes I want to teach.

Next I opened my IDE and started developing the application and the corre

## Selling the Course Content


- Creating the Landing Page
- Writing engaging salescopy
- Get early testimonials from the ecosystem (other well-known content creator)


But whome to sell?

Well, selling something to a audience of size zero is.

Back then I already had a newsletter audience of 2000 people. Those people however all had different interests as my blogging areas was quite broad. That's why the unsubscribe rate once I announced this course (multiple times) was quite high. Which is okay. They weren't my target audience.

Seeing the sales coming in, I also started to create ads on various platforms. 

But this doesn't work for a ($150+) product. THe chance that a cold lead (someone who doesn't know you) will click the ad and immediately buy is quite low.

Finding the right balance for hard selling. I was (and still am) super convincend that my online course on Testing can help so many developers deploy and write code with more confidence. That's why it might have seemed a little bit aggressive in the early days. I might have screwed some visitors or newsletter subscribers. That's the price you pay for learning. 

As the sales were low in the beginning.

## Learnings After One Year

Get a first version out as soon as possible

If you're selling to EU customers, rather pick a merchant of record to sell your stuff. Take some minutes to read about VAT handling of digital goods and you'll thank me later. I'm still handling VAT for myself and the effort is reasonable. Both SendOwl and Quaderno work quite well together.

- Don't try to have the perfect tech setup from day one

- People will ask for a refund, that's fine. I have a refund rate of 1%. Most of those refunds expected a different course structure. 

- Don't expect your course participants to go throug the course immediately. That was one of the interesting findings. I for myself usually always started a course I've bougth right away. That's not the case for everybody. I still see participants that did not even start with lesson one. That's okay - they might start when they have time.

- Affiliate marketing is king. There are tons of bloggers out there that might want some extra money each month to pay their hosting/tooling bills. 

- Support purchase power parity.

We live in a world with different purchase power and wages. Buying a course for $179 as a developer working in the valley might be totally fine. That's not the case for all other countries around the globe.

I didn't have this from day one and several visitors asked for it. My main excuse was that my eCommerce setup doesn't support it. 

I've made $ 34.674 in revenue after one year. The margin is also quite high as my only expenses are some hosting fees, marketing costs, and affiliate commissions.

The learnings were HUGE. Conversion rate, A/B testing, checkout process, learning how to sell, learning how to advertise, how to work on customer complaints etc.

Do it increcementally and start with the sales page. If you already have an audience, show them your plan and ask for their email if they'd like to get updates on it. This will give you a early indicator if there's interest in this topic.

## What I Would Have Made Differently

- Start with PPP from day one
