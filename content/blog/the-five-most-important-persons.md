You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.

Step back and think about this. 

Most probably those will be family members, friends and co-workers. Now collect some of their "achievements" 

- Mindset
- Money 
- Discipline
- Their habits? Are they smoking? Working out? Having their body in-shape? Drinking more that they should?

You should be quite close to them and on average have the same 

If you are not happy with what you have, you can hack this. Just surround yourself with people that have what you want to have.

I don't only mean this money & status-wise, as there is so much more to this. Think about how they live there live, what they expect from their life

> If you are the smartest person in the room - you are in the wrong room!

Let's face realitity. You want to push and make the most of your day/working-hours. Take extra time to evolve your skills, 

But the people around you don't ...

This might work for some months, but then their behavoir will block your progress. 

Be honest to yourself: Are you learning from the others or are they only benefiting from you?

This is not arrogant... In the end it's your life that gets shaped by the people around you.

While you also shouldn't be that selfish to only benefit from others, you have the duty to also support those looking up to you.

I once read about a nice balance of the 33%-rule. 

- Spent 33% with people that you are looking up to to mirror their behavoiur and improve. This might be devasating at they might seem unreachable, That's why you should ...
- Spent 33% with people that are on your level to exchange knowledge and 
- Last but not least, spent 33% of your time 

Decide with whom you spend your time because subconsciously you'll adopt to them.

This always guided most of my decision to move on in life.
