Hi :wave:

I'm Philip, a freelance IT consultant and indie hacker from Berlin :de:.

On my main blog [rieckpil.de](https://rieckpil.de/) I'm creating content under the slogan _Testing Java Applications Made Simple_ with a focus on Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, and AWS :leaves:

This site acts as a meta blog for topics that don't fit on a technical blog: freelancing, motivation, indie hacking, productivity, etc.

I've co-authored [Stratospheric](https://stratospheric.dev/) - an eBook on getting started with Spring Boot on AWS (Amazon Web Services) and am the co-founder of [Blogtrack](https://www.blogtrack.io/).

To demystify the name of this site:

progmot = Random thoughts about **prog**ramming & **mot**ivation

Enjoy reading my random thoughts,\
Philip
