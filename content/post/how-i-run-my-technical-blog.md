Server Side vs. good-old CMS

Man, this question bothered me a lost.  

While working with WordPress you might have to invest more into plugins. Have more patience when things are not working as expected.

Tweak stuff for good response time.

I went forth and back with themes, hosting, plugin selection, etc. but now found my good-enough setup!


I really paid off when starting to build a newsletter audience, quickly launch landing pages and now launch my first online course.

All of this 

As a developer for sure you might not like all the drag-an-drop and rather want to code this on your own.

But with their help you can focus on what matters the most: Creating quality content for your audience and niche.

Developing your own course managmeent systems and connecting to payment providers might be a lot of fun (and learings), but not the best time invest.


With this side however I'm focussing on more meta topics and give also Hugo a shot!

Here is my setup that I can recommend to everyone that is starting out!

Be aware, you have to INVEST money first. While we all take it for granted that our libraries and frameworks are open source, you sometimes have to pay to get the solution.

- Self-Hosting vServer at Hetzner (Tutorial for setup similar to DigitalOcean)
- WordPress Theme:
- WordPress plugins from Thrive!
- E-Commerce platform: SendOwl
- Newsletter solution: MailChimp
- Video hosting for online courses: Vimeo

With this setup you can start with their free or basic plans and have cost of about  15 - 30$ per month. My current costs are 110$ per month, but they bring me also four-digits in revenue. 

Remember: Those who want to harvest their crops have to sow them first ;) )

Happy blogging,
