Hardest to write article every.

Sharing intimae details. Showing myself vulnerable. I don't care now. All I care is to spread the word and potentially help someone out there to take the courage and get help.

Disclaimer: I'm not a therapist. This was **my** journey and experience. It may help, it may give you some inspiration (It may make things worse?). In the end always reach out to a professional and get help.

status quo.

May be not the classical lifestyle but

Self-emplyoed, anxiety about future projects, accounting, tax (to all my German self-employed friends: Nachtr√§gliche Steuervorauszahlung it is), life decisions

Running two businesses, doing freelance projects for clients

Overly ambitious, optimizing and sturcutring my day.

Planning my week ahead using Pomodori technique wiht blocks. Finishing all the stuff on my list was prio one.

Weekends?

Sure, but let me work on Saturday until lunch.

As I alawys feeling joy while doing these things, it never felt too much. But it was.



## How It Started

Loose joy in everyday life

Didn't want to see friends

Wanted to lay in bed the whole day

Blurry mind, this was killing me the most. I couldn't think straight. I couldn't remember things. I couldn't focus on a task for more than 10 minutes.

I was in a constant state of brain fog and always comparing my current producitivy level to past months. That was killing me.

I couldn't let my self of. You're self-employed, nobody cares, so get going.

I felt lonely. Working on your own as a lonley wolf. I was looking for a working and flourshining team.

(Search for unfog your mind on YouTube).



Started in September 2022, "ended" beginning of 2023

Foggy mind
No memory
No memory of past experiences

- breath work
- reach out to therapist
- take your time
- I had all the mental models and quotes in my head to potentially help me, but they

I was reading non-ficiton books about personal developemnt for ages. Watching talks of famous speakers like Jim Rohn, Jaes Brown, and Dieter Lange (German only content).

While I knew that "The darkest hour is the hour before sunrise" or "we fail not because of the things but because of our expectations", ... in these particual days there weren't of any help.

What made a lot of fun, fell down like a house of cards.

Constant questions filled my days:

- Was I too overambitious?
- Did I set my goals too high?
- Is this all worth it?
- Did I waste my 20ties?
- Am I neglecting times with family and friends?


## Getting Help

Opening up to friends and family.

Talking openly about my situation.

Get professional help. But how? Before Christmas on such a short notice? THat's not possible.

Luckily I then found instahelp. GOt a session right the next day


## Don't Expect a Quick Fix From Others

I was expecting a solution and fix from everyone. When talking about my problems, I was always waiting for a concerete solution. Should I go a year abroad? Should I quit my job? Should I start a new hobby?

The first therapy sessions and the chit chat felt I'm at the wrong place. Why does this professional not provide me a step-by-step soultion out of my current situation?

Because ...

... there is no such thing.

Nobody can and should dictate you what to do. You have to find your own way out of the situation.

Speaking therpy helped. Indentify underlying issues.

It was also really benefical to talk to someone outside of my bubble.

All my freinds, colleagues, and family knew me for years. Having someone whithout any background knowledge was really benefical.

Looking back, I must say, these therapy sessions where the best personal investment I've **ever made**. As the quote goes, the best investment you can make is in yourself. Nothing pays a higher dividend than improving yourself and your skills.

Think about it.

## Focus on Your Breath and Breath Correctly

If I would have to give you my single biggest lifehack: It's breath work.

During a therapie session, my therapist prepared me for a hypnosis. She said I should start and concerente on breathing throug the belly.

I couldn't do that.

We took the extra mile and she explained me on what to focus.

I was breathing through the chest. The fight & flight mode. Not the calm & relaxing mode our body is designed for.

Was I breathing wrong for my entire life?

I started to focus on my breath. I started to do breath work sessions...

... and it worked.

Whenver something is coming up inside me or there's a conflict, I remain calm, take deep breathes and focus on breathing through the belly.

What a game changer.

## My Path Forward

I can happily say that each day is a blessing. I'm grateful each morning to wake up and have the opportunity to make the best out of the day.

If this would be an AI model, my current fitness function is to optimize joy of life each day.

What else is there to aim for?

I say no way more often now. Without any bad feelings. If something doesn't work for me or does not increase my joy of life, I'm out. Period, no discussion.

Balance


Dark days. Pretty dark ...

Have a good one,
Phil
