Hardest to write article ever.

Sharing intimate details. Showing myself vulnerable. I don't care now. All I care is to spread the word and potentially help someone out there to take the courage and get help.

Disclaimer: I'm not a therapist. This was _my journey and experience_. It may help, it may give you some inspiration (It may make things worse?). In the end always reach out to a professional and get help.

status quo.

May be not the classical lifestyle but

Self-emplyoed, anxiety about future projects, accounting, tax (to all my German self-employed friends: Nachträgliche Steuervorauszahlung it is), life decisions

Running two businesses, doing freelance projects for clients

ambitious (maybe overly ambitious)?, optimizing and restructuring my day. Very little alcohol, sport at least three times a week.

Planning my week ahead using Pomodori technique with blocks. Finishing all the stuff on my list was prio one.

Weekends?

Obsessed with perfection.

"God laid down this law, saying: if you want some good, get it from yourself." Epictetus.

Here is how to _guarantee_ you have a good day: do good things. Any other source of joy is outside your control or is nonrenewable. But this one is all you, all the time, and unending. It is the ultimate form of self-reliance.

Sure, but let me work on Saturday until lunch.

As I always feeling joy while doing these things, it never felt too much. But it was.


## How It Started

Loose joy in every day life activities. Going out for dinner with friends? Didn't feel right.

No progress.

Plateau because I was projecting past _success_ linear to the future. But it wasn't coming. That was depressing.

Am I doing to little? Did I do too much? Questions over questions.

While it first felt like a week off, I wasn't talking much about it to anyone. I'm also a rather introvert person. Logic & order, analytic mind, the classic IT guy.

Didn't want to see friends

Wanted to lay in bed the whole day. It was hard to get up. Especially comparing to what I could get done before.

Firewheel as I wasn't achieving much while it still got worse.


Blurry mind, this was killing me the most. I couldn't think straight. I couldn't remember things. I couldn't focus on a task for more than 10 minutes.

I was in a constant state of brain fog and always comparing my current producitivy level to past months. That was killing me.

I couldn't let my self of. You're self-employed, nobody cares, so get going.

I felt lonely. Working on your own as a lonley wolf. I was looking for a working and flourshining team.

(Search for unfog your mind on YouTube).

Mid life ciris? Quater life ciris? Burnout? Depression? I don't know.

In the end, to me it felt like a lot of things coming together with a quarter life crisis.

Started in September 2022, "ended" beginning of 2023

No memory
No memory of past experiences

- breath work
- reach out to therapist
- take your time
- I had all the mental models and quotes in my head to potentially help me, but they

I was reading non-ficiton books about personal development for ages. Watching talks of famous speakers like Jim Rohn, Les Brown, and Dieter Lange (German only content).

While I knew that "The darkest hour, is the hour before dawn" or "we fail not because of the things but because of our expectations", ... in these particular days there weren't of any help.

What made a lot of fun, fell down like a house of cards.

Constant questions filled my days:

- Was I too overambitious?
- Did I set my goals too high?
- Is this all worth it?
- Did I waste my 20ties?
- Am I neglecting times with family and friends?

My brain was constantly throwing different reasons and potential solutions at me. That was hard. Every day I had thought I found the _root cause_ and the solution.

- Throw everything away and do something good for society like becoming a medic
- Go away for a year and do nothing
- Become a monk
- Go back to one of my old jobs. There I know the team and what to expect
- etc.

Comparing myself with others. Comparison is the death of happiness

Got inactive on social media, deleted the apps. Didn't care

## Getting Help

Opening up to friends and family.

Talking openly about my situation.

Get professional help. But how? Before Christmas on such a short notice? THat's not possible.

Luckily I then found Instahelp. This is a platform for matching clients with therapist. You'll answer some questions and the platform will suggest a list of therapist to contact. You can decide to chat with them, do audio only or go all-in with a video chat.

Got a session right the next day

After the initial 30 minutes getting to know each other call, we immediately scheduled a session on a weekly sessions. 50 minutes. I've never done something like this before and wasn't sure what I was up to.

I was afraid. What can I tell this stranger? How will it work?

## Don't Expect a Quick Fix From Others

I was expecting a solution and fix from everyone. When talking about my problems, I was always waiting for a concerete solution. Should I go a year abroad? Should I quit my job? Should I start a new hobby?

The first therapy sessions and the chit chat felt I'm at the wrong place. Why does this professional not provide me a step-by-step soultion out of my current situation?

Because ...

... there is no such thing.

Nobody can and should dictate you what to do. You have to find your own way out of the situation.

Speaking therapy helped. Identify underlying issues.

It was also really benefical to talk to someone outside of my bubble.

All my freinds, colleagues, and family knew me for years. Having someone whithout any background knowledge was really benefical.

Looking back, I must say, these therapy sessions where the best personal investment I've **ever made**. As the quote goes, the best investment you can make is in yourself. Nothing pays a higher dividend than improving yourself and your skills.

Think about it.

## Focus on Your Breath and Breath Correctly

If I would have to give you my single biggest lifehack: It's breath work.

During a therapie session, my therapist prepared me for a hypnosis. She said I should start and concerente on breathing throug the belly.

I couldn't do that.

We took the extra mile and she explained me on what to focus.

I was breathing through the chest. The fight & flight mode. Not the calm & relaxing mode our body is designed for.

Was I breathing wrong for my entire life?

I started to focus on my breath. I started to do breath work sessions...

... and it worked.

Whenever something is coming up inside me or there's a conflict, I remain calm, take deep breathes and focus on breathing through the belly.

What a game changer.

It felt like running away something. But running towards what? I didn't know. More success? More money? More things?

## My Path Forward

![](/img/mental-health/new-beginning.png#center)

I can happily say that each day is a blessing. I'm grateful each morning to wake up and have the opportunity to make the best out of the day.

If this would be an AI model, my current fitness function is to optimize joy of life each day.

What else is there to aim for?

I say no way more often now. Without any bad feelings. If something doesn't work for me or does not increase my joy of life, I'm out. Period, no discussion.

Balance. My work setup allows for it. Work less for clients, do more that feels right in the current moment. I'm aware that this suggestion might not work for everyone.

Listen closely to myself. I planned to achieve X today but feel more like doing Y? Go for Y and don't feel bad.

I've identified and defined three guiding principles for me: Freedom, Harmony and Adventure. Anything that doesn't pay towards it, is not an option.

Life is both sugar and strychnine (check this short from Jim Ron). There's ebb and flow. There's good and bad. There's joy and pain. There's light and darkness.

Dark days. Pretty dark ...

Life's a positive-sum game. Help each other. Swallow your pride.


# it became worse.

Suicidal thoughts

Somethign that outstanding people might not understand.

Hard to talk about, tell your family you want to end it?



One quote that helped me a lot:

- "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."
- "Sucide doesn't end the pain, it just transfers it to the person you love"
- "The darkest hour is the hour before dawn"

Does calender sprüche didn't help much in that situation

You are numb.

Exposing this may not make me more friends, people will put me in a schublade but I'd rather be ignored by many and help at least one person go through it than not

In the end, we are all humans

What helped me, closer to family, Ikigai, sturm und drang phase
endless comparison
social media

Get help,
 there is good help available, it takes time, trust
therahpy, nothing wrong, our brains are not made for this

Fallback may come, but now way more equipped


Agenda:
 Ausgangslage
First downer
Coming back
Second downer
Coming back
Third downer?
Somethign to adjust, iterate


numbness, meaningelss, i was searching for a solution in comments on YouTube
I wanted to get the answer to this problem from the outside
But that was a einbahnstraße
three weeks in tagesklinik

Help by family, friends, therapist, and myself
While that help sometimes didn't feel like help, it was the best thing that could happen to me

Talk to someone, they will listen and get help!

Brain fog, memory loss, no joy in life, no joy in activities, no joy in work, no joy in anything
Nothing felt right, nothing felt good, nothing felt like it used to be
No confidence, no self-esteem, no self-wort

Have a good one,\
Phil
