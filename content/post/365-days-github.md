I published my first article on Medium about a developer habit I started one year ago. To improve my personal development skills, I dedicated at least **30 minutes every day to code** and learn something new. Looking back after **365 days**, I can totally recommend it to everyone to take time out of the usual schedule to improve your skills.

Developer Habit: Committing code to GitHub for 365 consecutive days
-------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Medium post for Developer Habit Write Code For 365 consecutive days](/img/blog-content/30-minutes-every-day-for-your-craft-committing-code-to-github-for-365-consecutive-days-1.png)](https://medium.com/@rieckpil/30-minutes-every-day-for-your-craft-committing-code-to-github-for-365-consecutive-days-eec8b73b5105)

My main motivation to start working on my skills every day was inspired by the following quote:

> *Professionals practice. \
> \
> True professionals work hard to keep their skills sharp and ready. It is not enough to simply do your daily job and call that practice.\
> \
> Doing your daily job is performance, not practice.\
> \
> Practice is when you specifically exercise your skills outside of the performance of your job for the sole purpose of refining and enhancing those skills. \
> (The Clean Code, Page 19)*

For a visual representation of my streak, I used the GitHub contribution view. This visual factor was really important as it helps to establish and proceed with a new habit, as you don't want to lose your track.

TL;DR for all impatient readers:

* Do it in the**morning hours**, you might be tired after work and you'll start your day with an already achieved task
* Find**interesting** and**challenging tasks** to work on e.g. use online tutorials (Udemy, YouTube ...) and code with the instructor in parallel
* **Stick** to your decision and **track**what you've already achieved
* Learn something new to become a **generalist** with **one or more specialists** (a better term for full-stack these days)
* **Have fun** while doing it otherwise it will be hard to stick to it

Have fun establishing your developer habits,\
