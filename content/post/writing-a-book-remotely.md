Short intro about this article. What worked, how we organized ourselves. The book is all about AWS and Spring Boot. Getting your Spring Boot application into production.

Three co-authors: Tom, Björn, Philip.

## How we got together

Small anecdote how it started with a simple Tweet by Tom.
We next met with the intent to share experience as tech bloggers. During the second or third meeting of this kind, Tom asked for fellow bloggers that would be interested in taking a closer look at AWS and Spring Boot and may want to write about it.

Björn and me who were participating in this meeting raised our hands and we met for the first time


## How it started

In the first meetings that we organized bi-weekly we were first getting to know each other better. This included the current experience with AWS and what our plans with this project would be.

We then met constantly every two weeks and

We started with the project name `aws101`. However, was this was clearly violating trademarks of AWS, we had to find another name. As the book is all about getting ready for the cloud and effectively deploy applications to production in the cloud, the symbol of a starting rocket seemed natural.

We ordered two design exampels for the logo on Fiverr and picked the best:

While the AWS CDK was getting more and more traction in the meantime, we decided to rework the infrastructure setup and use the CDK instead of CloudFormation templates.

Stratospheric

Not much in-depth content for this complex domain. We all had some experience with AWS but there were clearly parts that we're not understanding in detail

Project to learn and will learning produce something

## Getting Started with the book

As this project was or all three of us a side-project and nothing we do full time, we all agreed that working with a formal publisher is no option for us. Setting deadlines and having to deliver a final piece on a given date was something we wanted to avoid.

As Tom already had self-published an eBook on Leanpub before, we went for Leanpub as their services are appeling for self-publishing tech authors:

- write the manuscript in Markdown
- formatting comes automatically
- direct integration with a GitHub repository
- fair pricing with 80% royalties

Release early and often. They favor the approach of giving access to a book early while its still in development.

We choose Leanpub as it's tech-friendly, easy-to-setup and great royalties. Leanpub is a self publishing platform mostly focussing on tech books.

To gain some traction and to see if there's interest for such a book, we started with a basic landing page and collecting email addresses for a mailing list.


Made a lot of fun, learned a ton about AWS, met and get to know great and knowledgeable people

Iterative approach, collect emails from interested

Meeting schedules, continuous sprints, peer review

All changes were reviewed by all of us

`main` branch -> final output
`preview` branch -> generate a preview PDF

We were writing our content on feature branches and integrated them into the `preview` branch. Once we had enough reviewed sections in the `preview` branch, we released a new

Automation: We could even directly release from the main branch, but we prefer to still do it manually. PDF, Kindle, ePub format.

The final result was release on the first of August 2021: 450 pages long eBook

We even organized a small release party where we talked about the project, the sample application and hit the release button together.

Since the release, we're still meeting each other on a bi-weekly basis. We add reader feedback, keep the source code up-to-date and add new section where it makes sense.
