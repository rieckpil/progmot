> Life happens outside your comfort zone, the rest is just repetition.

For a long time, I've been thinking to give a talk at a public conference. While I've already gave technical sessions and smaller talks internally for colleagues or clients, I never stood on stage.

Back at the 27th of May 2022, I could tick off this item from my bucket list as I gave my first talk: "How fixing a broken window cut down our build time by 50%" at the [Spring I/O](https://springio.net) in Barcelona. The conference had 1200 attendees, around 60 speaker and more than 150 attendees came to my talk.

This article describes my journey to giving my first talk including my lessons learned and how I prepared for this event.

## Deciding to Give a Talk

There was this one item on my yearly goal list that I kept moving to my next year's goal list. I was procrastination a lot on giving my first public talk and always wanted to find the right moment. While I submitted some talk ideas to three different conferences, back in 2019, none of them got accepted.  Somehow by none of these submissions I was feeling that I really want to give this talk. It was a more self obligated duty to just submit something so that I can tell myself I tried it.

When the whole work from home period started, I first thought a remote conference might be easy to get started. However, I wanted to experience standing in front of a real audience and not stare into a screen.

Actually, I have seen many speakers complain that the online conference are sometimes even harder because you have no immediate feedback from the audience. Even worse, if every participant turns of their camera, you can't see at all how your talk is going.

That's why I decided to pause this goal and wait until in-person conferences are happening again.

Then somewhere around the beginning of 2022 I saw on Twitter that the CFP (call for papers) for the Spring I/O 2022 started. The Spring I/O is a community organized (mainly by Sergi Almar) conference in Barcelona, Spain. Its focus is the Spring framework which is the de facto standard framework (next to Jakarta EE and Quarkus) for developing Java applications. The Sprig I/O conference is a community organized conference and has no affiliation with VMWare. It was the 9th iteration of this conference and in the past, more than 1000 participated.

During the pandemic, they switched to a remote conference and the conference in 2022 should be the first in-person conference after this break.

I somehow felt that this is the right conference for me as it's fit 100% my blogging niche, and I know various previous speakers that I could ask for help and insights.

For a long time I've always had a talk idea in my head. It was a project experience with a great learning analogy and background information. It was both full of actionable takeaways, lessons learned, and practical advice based on a real project on software development.

After spending 30 minutes on finalizing the talk title, elevator pitch and description, I submitted the talk.

I didn't think that this may be too big of an audience for an unknown speaker with zero experience on a public stage. I thought "Let's submit the talk and see what happens" ...

## Getting Accepted for the Conference

On the XY of March 2022 I got a positive CoVID test result after feeling sick for almost two days ðŸ˜£

To recover and relax, I enjoyed the entire day on my couch and surfed on the web and watched YouTube videos.

Somewhere around 3pm that day, I checked my emails and found an email from the Spring I/O conference...

I WAS ACCEPTED!

TODO: Screenshot of accepting email from Sergi.

As there is quite some gap between the deadline for the CFP and the day the organizers announce the lucky speakers, I almost had already forgotten that I submitted a talk.

What a feeling of joy at this point sitting in my apartment while having COVID and being sick.

It was an entire emotional roller coaster this day. In the morning, the proof that I had a COVID infection (I thought the day is over) and in the afternoon the confirmation email that I'm a speaker at the conference. I couldn't be more happy that day. The sickness was secondary that day.

Looking back, it seems that I was quite lucky being selected while having just one talk submitted. While many call for papers allow you to submit multiple different talks, I went all in with this one. The main reasons was that only for this particular talk I was feeling confident enough to present it as my first talk on a public conference.

With the talk being accepted, the countdown started to prepare the talk and train for the conference day. I only had the title, elevator pitch and a description. There was no single slide yet ...

## Preparing the Talk

The requirements for this talk were crystal clear: I got 50 minutes to present the talk and answer slides. The language has to be English as it's an international audience. As a high-level ballpark figure, I was expecting 150-250 attendees for my talk as the overall conference had 1200 attendees and four parallel tracks.

While I had some basic bullet points and ideas for the talk in mind, I did not start with the actual preparation 60 days before the conference.

I didn't want to prepare my slides all at once and decided to rather invest 1-2h every day to work on the talk. I already had the rough roten faden in my head and just needed to put my outline _on paper_.

This continuous talk creation helped me stay creative and not work under pressure one week before the talk.

It was a lessons learned from a project where we optimized our integration test setup and could reduce the overall build time by 50% from 26 to 12 minutes.

I frequently switched places for this kind of work and primarily prepared the talk in cafes or in cozy co-working places in Berlin:

While I hadn't done any major presentation recently, I picked Google Slides as this was the presentation software I was most familiar with. I picked a slide theme and adjusted it to my _brand colors_:

It was clear that I didn't want to perform any live coding on stage for my first talk. That's why I included all code examples as screenshots.

For the slide design, I tried to balance text-only and graphical slides (including memes) to keep the talk exciting.

The common thread throughout my talk was about the "Broken Windows Theory" (link wikipedia). While this theory comes from the criminological area, it can be applied to almost everything. In short, this theory describes that rural areas where there's much litter on the ground, damaged cars, rundown houses, the likelihood that similar _crime_ happens is more likely than in a neighbourhood where everything is spotless.

We can transfer this analogy to software projects. As soon as a team member introduces a not so optimal workaround to our code base, the more likely other developers will follow. This can drain our overal project health as the first _broken window_ entails potentially more broken windows.

Back in 2019 I was working in a project where we had such a broken window inside our codebase. It resulted in ever increasing build times and the overall team motivation started to decline. After some initial hurdles, we could fix this broken window and bring our project health back to a clean state.

I gave the talk a week before the conference started to myself and recorded the screen and my camera. This acted both as a trial run as well as a backup plan. Given the unclear Corona situiation, I might get positive and may not be able to hold the talk. I thought that if I preapre the talk I can send it to the organizers, and they can at least play the video for the attendees. Fortunately, that backup option was never used.

I tried this trial run to be as close to later. I used my standing desk and the presenter to get, as we would say in software development, close to production as possible.

Second trial run two days before. As I'm a bit superstitious, I thought the final must be my third attempt aka. all good things are three.

## The Conference Day

One or two sentences for the speaker dinner before the first conference day.

First day with a picture of all speakers, Crazy feeling. All other conferences I was just an attendee

Felt so grateful, a little bit like a star to join the conference as a speaker and not as an attendee. I got the chance to meet many other speaker, many of which I'm following on Twitter and aspire, at the speaker dinner.

My talk was the second last on the last conference day. 5 PM when it's super nice in Barcelona.

The mental pressure, watching talks for two days while knowning you have to give your talk almost at the end. Almost like in school when it was time to hold presentations and you were the last. Sitting in the class room, getting more neverous, the more your friends finish theirs.

But it actually wasn't that. I could really enjoy the time before my talk. Maybe not the last talk before mine, but that's okay.

## Giving the Talk

Fortunately, there was a 30-minute coffee break before my talk. Hence, there was no rush between two talks, and I could prepare the setup and get used to the stage and atmosphere. I arrived 20 minutes before the talk started, set up my machine, and connected to the beamer.

While there were already some attendees sitting in the audience, most of them were enjoying their coffee break.

I used this gap time to check some slights on the big projector and made sure to close all applications on my Mac that could disturb the talk.

10 minutes before the talk started, I got the mobile microphone from the sound team. Now it got serious.

Right on time at 5pm when the organizers closed the doors, I started my talk.

First, I greeted the audience and thanked them that they came to my talk on a Friday afternoon 5pm while it's perfect weather outside in Barcelona.

After the first 4-5 sentences, the initial peak excitement faded away, and I started to really enjoy talking about a topic I really care.

There was no major problem during the talk as I didn't live code and had all code examples stripped down to their minimum and included as a screenshot.

After 48 minutes, I finished my last "Conclusion & FAQ" slide and the talk was over.

What a feeling at this point in time!

Unfortunately the 2 minutes left weren't enough to answer questions as the next speaker was lining up to give his talk in just 12 minutes.

Nevertheless, more than 10 attendees came to me right after the talk to ask their questions and to thank me for giving this talk. We went outside the room to avoid any disturbance for the next speaker and discussed their questions with no rush.

I guess that's a good sign if there's interest after your talk.

## Afterthoughts

Feeling of joy that I got out of my comfort zone.
Timing-wise I could have done a bit better. While my session was planned for 50 minutes, I finished my talk within 48 minutes and hence had no time to answer questions directly from the audience. Nevertheless, I tried to help everyone that came to me after the talk and we took a standing desk outside to discuss details or specific problems.

After giving the talk, I was both super happy and releaxed that I did it. I immediately thought about what talks I can prepare next as I enjoyed the entire experience of being a speaker at a conference.


The final slide deck is [available on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/rieckpil/how-fixing-a-broken-window-cut-down-our-build-time-by-50-percent).

Kudos belong to [Sergi Almar](https://twitter.com/sergialmar/) and his entire team for the amazing organization of this event!

In summary, these are the tips and recommendations:
- trial run
- try presentations in-house
- get a mentor or buddy to help out with the slide deck and talk preparation (I didn't had one but advice for it if you've done not many other public speaking session inside your company)
- record yourself (I use ScreenFlow for this, the QuickTimePlayer of MacOS also works here)
- cut the recording to have a plan B if everything goes south. Imagine a positive COVID test right before the conference. This way, you can at least send the recording to the organizers and they can play it inside the room.
- check the hardware before and have backup options
- have fun
- don't do live coding on your first talk
- have fallbacks for everything
- Use big font sizes
- Don't overuse bullet points that make your audience tired, fresh up things with graphics, images and short summaries
- Upload your slide deck to Speaker Deck afterward
- Don't use dark themes when screenshotting your code examples (I use the distraction free mode of IntelliJ IDEA for my screenshots)
- Talk water and maybe some throat candy to the stage if your voice starts cracking
- Wear cloths that you feel comfortable

To many more talks ðŸš€

Have fun preparing your first talk,\
Philip
