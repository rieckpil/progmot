Giving my first talk at a conference, lessons learned and my preparation.

## Decision ot give a talk

For two years already, always moving this yearly goal of mine to the next year. When the whole work from home period started, I first tought a remote conference might be easy to get started. However, I wanted to experience standing in front of a real audience and not stare into a screen.

Actually, I have seen many speakers complain that the online conference are sometimes even harder because you have no immediate feedback from the audience. Even worse, if every participant turns of their camera, you can't see at all how your talk is going.

That's why I decided to pause this goal and wait until in-person conferences are happening again.

I submitted a talk, the idea for this talk was in my head for quite some time. It was a project experience with a nice analogy and background. It was both full of actionable takeaways, as well as lessons learned, erfahrungsbericht and general advice on software development.

Submitted for the Spring I/O 2022 in Barcelona. The Spring framewrok is the defacto standard Java framwework (next to Jakarta EE and Quarkus) for developing Java applicaitons. The main open source effort comes from employees at VMWare (now Broadcom). The Sprig I/O conference is a community organized conference and has no affiliation with VMWare. It was the 9th iteration of this conference and in the past, more than 1000 participated.

I didn't thought that this may be too big of an audience for an unknown speaker with zero experience on the stage. I do have held various talks and presentation in-house, but never in front of a public audience.

I thought "Let's submit the talk and see what happens"

## Getting Accepted

On XYZ, I got my positive COVID test result and was feeling ill and both sad. I enjoyed the entire day on my couch and surfed on the web and watched YouTube videos.

Somewhere around 3pm that day, I checked my emails and found an email from the Spring I/O conference.

I WAS ACCEPTED!

What a feeling achterbahn this day. In the morning, the proof that I had a COVID infecation (I thought the day is over) and in the afternoon the confirmation email that I'm a speaker at the conference. I couldn't be more happy that day.


## Preparing

The goal: 40-45 min talk in English

TODO: Find the images where I gradually created the slide deck

Almost 60 days before the conference started. I didn't to it all at once and rather invested 1-2h every day to fine tune and polish the talk. I already had the rough roten faden in my head and just needed to put my outline _on paper_.


I gave the talk a week before the conference started to myself and recorded the screen and my camera. This acted both as a trial run as well as a backup plan. Given the unclear Corona situiation, I might get positive and may not be able to hold the talk. I thought that if I preapre the talk I can send it to the organizers and they can at least play the video for the attendees. Fortunately, that backup option was never used.

I tried this trial run to be as close to later. I used my standing desk and the presenter to get, as we would say in software development, close to production as possible.

Second trial run two days before. As I'm a bit abergl√§ubig, I thought the final must be my third attempt aka. all good things are three.


## The Conference Day

Felt so grateful, a little bit like a star to join the conference as a speaker and not as an attendee. I got the chance to meet many other speaker, many of which I'm following on Twitter and aspire, at the speaker dinner.

My talk was the second last on the last conference day. 5 PM when it's super nice in Barcelona.

The mental pressure, watching talks for two days while knowning you have to give your talk almost at the end. Almost like in school when it was time to hold presentations and you were the last. Sitting in the class room, getting more neverous, the more your friends finish theirs.

But it actually wasn't that. I could really enjoy the time before my talk. Maybe not the last talk before mine, but that's okay.


## Giving the talk


## After:

Feeling of joy that I got out of my comfort zone.

Tips:
- trial run
- try presentations in-house
- get a mentor or buddy to help out
- record yourself
- check the hardware before and have backup options
- have fun

Have fun preparing your first talk,\
Philip
